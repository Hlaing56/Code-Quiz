# Code-Quiz

smalls things first-

1. make the header with a link to highscore and a timer that start when you click start quiz
2. make the question div box
3. in the main body make it so when you click start quiz or one of the multiple answers it takes you to the first or next qustion div box

#1 is done but timer doesnt work, do #2 then put in timer buttom press function

#1 & 2 are done. I have it where when I click the button the timer starts

use set atturbuite to show next question and hide the others

did all three, now make is so the options are clickable and add classes for right or worng

things to do (not in order)

1. figure out how to make it so it can tell you if you answered wrong on not
2. mkae it so when worng, minus time from timer
3. after you answered all the questions give your time from timer as highscore
4. save highscore into local storage

right just get it so when all questions answered stop timer and give highscore

PUT THE QUESTIONS INTO OBJECTS

setintervel to make it stop

it looks trash but I have most things to work,
just need the score to save into local,
make the div for highscore and have user input saved for name, then load the saved data

make a new box pop up for highscore

everything works and this homework challege is almost done
now just make it look good and make a clear highscore function
good job
